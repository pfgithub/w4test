// simple computer
// 16 instructions (4x4 grid to be easy)
// 16 registers | stack-based

// what instructions?
// - push
// - add
// - sub

// blocks:
// - open block
// - close block
// - conditional re-execute specified block
// actually top level could just be a list of blocks and you can call a block or something
// we could connect them with lines
// - conditional jump (jumps to block 1 if true else block 2)
// - or just "jump to block #"

// oh and we can make a tis-100 game out of this

// due to storage constraints, we may not be able to save the execution state

// or we could try to make a scratch-like thing
// you can draw sprites and add code
