// ok so either we write the game with 63K of memory already used
// or we compress wordle_choices a bit

// ok so first off:
// there are 26 possible chars
// we can compress that down to a packed int array of u5 trivially or even u4sa
// and then the other thing we can do is there are lots of words for each starting
// letter so we can just add an escape code to switch to the next starting letter
// ok just doing u5s takes our 64860 and compresses it to 40538 which is good enough
// and u4s would put it to ~32k but a bit more because the least frequently
// used characters would take like two u4s rather than one
// I'm just going to do u4s, it's easier I think

// NOTE: word must be in both wordle_choices and wordle_answers
